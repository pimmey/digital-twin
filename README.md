## Data persistence
Data is persisted using [React Native Async Storage](https://github.com/react-native-async-storage/async-storage). Currently, there is no functionality to purge the data using the UI, but it can be done by editing `./data/store.ts` where it says:
```ts
// Uncomment to reset data :-)
// persistor.purge()
```
